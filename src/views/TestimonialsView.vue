      <p class="card-text">Nozipho very rarely struggles to the point of needing any help, which shows   off traits that presents
                     her as a really fast & strong learner, that's able to assess a problem at hand and solve it within
                     minutes. Nozipho also comes across as shy and quiet, but once engaging in conversation she
                     shows off her great sense of humor.</p>
